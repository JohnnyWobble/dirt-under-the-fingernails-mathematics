            This year, at the 2021 <span class="italics bold">Virginia Summer Residential Governor’s School for
                Mathematics,
                Science and Technology</span>
            at <span class="italics bold">University of Lynchburg</span>, 20 of us elected to enroll in <span
                class="italics bold">Dirt Under the Fingernail Mathematics</span>, and not one
            of us regretted it. Taught by <a class="body" href="http://faculty.randolphcollege.edu/mordower/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Ordower</a>, this was the most fascinating math course any of us had
            ever
            taken. Requiring nothing more than algebra, basic precalculus, and a love for math, Dr. Ordower designed a
            curriculum to teach through a variety of games, puzzles, and hands on activities, that amazed us with new
            concepts and ideas every day.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Throughout the course we learned about systems which evolve over time, combinatorial game theory, number
            theory, graph theory, and cellular automaton. Throughout the course, Dr. Ordower had a very dynamic
            curriculum allowing us to spend days exploring niche interests and journeying down rabbit holes.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Overall, everyone agrees that the class was fantastic, everyday brought a new discovery. As one student
            said, “it was like relearning basic arithmetic and algebra”. The wholeheartedly agrees that Dr. Ordower is
            one of the best teachers they’ve ever had. He is extremely enthusiastic, incredibly knowledgable, and super
            nice.
